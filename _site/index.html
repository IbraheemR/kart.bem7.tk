  <div class="img" id="4">And Used by Tesla in their electric cars</div>
  <div class="img" id="5">yet discarded at the slightest issue, or made to die so you will buy again</div>
  <div class="img" id="6">There's energy in our waste!</div>

  <div class="img" id="7">We've been inspired by the booming online community of makers who harvest this resource to power DIY electric vehicles</div>
  <div class="img" id="8">Such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/jehugarcia">Jehu Garcia</a>, the inspiration for this project, who revamped a derelict VW samba into a fully functional electric vehicle</div>
  <div class="img" id="9">Also using the same technology to build solar power packs, bringing relief to many puerto ricans who lost their homes last year.</div>

  <div class="img" id="10">We want to do the same - combining Greg's love for racing and my passion for electrical engineering</div>
  <div class="img" id="11">We want to build an electric go kart.</div>
  <div class="img" id="12">To power it, we will harvest and recondition 18650 cells form broken laptop batteries.</div>
  <div class="img" id="13">Perfectly good cells can be found in broken batteries, often only the control board or a few cells die</div>
  <div class="img" id="14">We've begun collecting materials, and are starting to recondition old batteries</div>
  <div class="img" id="15">We'll construct a wooden frame and repurpose old parts from Greg's track to build the kart.</div>
