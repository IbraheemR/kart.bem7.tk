# The RodSinski Go Kart

- The 16850 Cell (& picture)
- Powering todays technology (picture of batterbank/laptop etc)
- Used by Tesla in their electric cars
- Yet discarded at the slightest issue - built in redundancy
- There's energy in our waste

- Inspired by the booming online community of makers who harvest this resource to power DIY electric vehicles
- Such as Jehu Garcia (link to his youtube), the inspiration for this project, who revamped a derelict VW samba into a fully functional electric vehicle
- Also using the same technology to build solar power packs, bringing relief to many puerto ricans who lost their homes last year.

- We want to do the same - combining Greg's love for racing and my passion for electrical engineering we will build an electric go kart
- To power it , we will harvest and recondition 18650 cells form broken laptop batteries; perfectly good cells can be found in broken batteries
- often only the control board dies
- We've begun collecting materials, and are statring to recondition old batteries
- We'lll construct a wooden frame and repurpose old parts from greg's track to build the kart
